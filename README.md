# neighbourhood_safety_pdl_project

#📌 Overview

The Neighbourhood Safety Prediction System is a machine learning–based web application that predicts the safety level of a locality based on historical crime data and user-provided inputs. The goal is to help users make informed decisions about living, travelling, and daily activities by assessing area risk in real time.

#🎯 Problem Statement

People often lack reliable information about crime trends in their neighbourhoods. This leads to poor decision-making regarding travel, residence, or emergency planning.
This project aims to build an ML-powered tool that evaluates area safety and provides alert-based insights using available data.

🎯 Project Objectives

To analyse historical crime datasets and extract meaningful patterns.

To build an ML classification/regression model to estimate the safety score.

To provide an easy-to-use interface for users to check locality safety.

To enable real-time alerts or suggestions based on prediction results.

To support authorities and individuals in better decision-making.
